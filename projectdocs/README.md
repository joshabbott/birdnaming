## Similarity ratings of birds

Can we use the Pigot data to connect with some previous study that looked at human similarity judgments of birds? Candidates include

* Bailenson, Jeremy N., et al. "A bird's eye view: Biological categorization and reasoning within and across cultures." Cognition 84.1 (2002): 1-53.

* Boster, J.S., B. Berlin and J.P. O’Neill (1986), “The correspondence of Jivaroan to scientific ornithology”,
American Anthropologist 88:569–583.

* Boster, J.S. (1987), “Agreement between biological classification systems is not dependent on cultural transmission”,
American Anthropologist 89:914–919.

* Boster, J.S., and R.G.D’Andrade (1989), “Natural and human sources of cross-cultural agreement in ornithological
classification”, American Anthropologist 91(1):132–142.


We could potentially learn weights for the Pigot features that best capture the human taxonomies in the Bailenson et al article. Could then use the same feature weights for analyses of naming data from other cultures (e.g. Zapotec)
