\section{Introduction}

Languages around the world include rich systems of names for plants and animals, and each system can be viewed as the outcome of a natural experiment in which generations of speakers have organized their local environment into categories. A classic line of work in cognitive anthropology addresses the question of how named categories reflect the structure of the local environment~\cite{berlin2014ethnobiological}. One prominent theme is that folk taxonomies often align well with Western scientific taxonomies, suggesting that folk taxonomies are shaped more by environmental structure than by the idiosyncratic needs and concerns of a particular culture. 

Much of the cognitively-oriented work on folk biology took place last century, and in recent years new data sets have made it possible to characterize the structure of the environment in ways that were previously difficult or impossible~\cite{sullivan2009ebird,wilman2014eltontraits}. Here we draw on these resources to revisit the classic question of the relationship between named categories and the environment. We focus on birds in particular, and begin by compiling properties of the bird species in a given area (e.g.\ how big is each species, and how often is it observed?) We then study how these properties relate to named bird categories in the local language. In particular, we ask whether the frequency of a species influences whether the species is named, and if so whether frequency influences the form of the name for that species and how many other species it is grouped with. 

The effects of frequency on categorization have been previously studied in the psychological literature~\cite{parducci83,nosofsky88,barsalouhl98}.  One relevant finding is that categories tend to be relatively broad in low-frequency regions of stimulus space, but relatively narrow in regions including frequently encountered stimuli~\cite{parducci83}. We might therefore predict that bird species encountered frequently are more likely to be assigned to their own distinctive categories.  

Our focus on frequency also connects with a prominent debate between \emph{intellectualist} ~\cite{berlin2014ethnobiological} and \emph{utilitarian} ~\cite{hunn1982utilitarian} accounts of folk classification. The intellectualist view holds that named categories reflect ``fundamental biological discontinuities'' that are perceptually salient (Berlin, 1992 p 53)~\nocite{berlin2014ethnobiological}, and assigns a minimal role to freqeuncy. The utilitarian view emphasizes ways in which categories are useful for a given culture, and naturally accommodates frequency effects because assigning a label to a category is especially worthwhile if there are many occasions to use it.

The next section introduces the data sets that we use, and we then address two broad questions. First, we focus on category extensions, and ask whether environmental factors predict whether a species is named, and how the set of named species is organized into groups. Second, we focus on category labels, and ask whether environmental factors predict the relative lengths of category labels, and which labels have the structure of unmarked prototypes. 


\section{Data sets}

The literature contains detailed folk classifications of birds from several languages around the world, and we focus here on named bird categories from Zapotec \cite{hunn2008zapotec}, a language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico.  We used two data sets that characterize the frequency and size of bird species found in Oaxaca, and a third that specifies how these species are organized into named categories.

\subsection{Frequency data}

Our frequency data are drawn from eBird, a citizen-science based bird observation network managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology \cite{sullivan2009ebird}.  eBird data are contributed by bird lovers (both professional and amateur) who use the site to record the time and place of bird sightings.  We used data from just the region containing the state of Oaxaca, Mexico\footnote{We used all eBird observation of frequency from the Basic Dataset (EBD) on https://ebird.org/data/download, last accessed January 24, 2020.}. An observer who sees a group of 5 vultures may record both the species (e.g.\ \emph{Cathartes aura}) and the number of birds in the group (5), but we treated each case like this as a single observation of the species in question. Our data for Oaxaca include 660,223 unique observations of 922 distinct species. 

We will take eBird counts as a very rough proxy for the frequency with which a species is encountered in the course of regular life. The fact that nocturnal species will tend to have lower counts than equally common diurnal species is therefore a strength of the data rather than a limitation. eBird, however,  does not provide an unbiased measure of frequency in everyday life. As a group, eBird contributors are more interested in some species than others, and counts for rare but iconic species (e.g.\ the Bald eagle in the USA) will overestimate the frequency with which they are encountered relative to other species. Even so, eBird is a valuable resource that allows rough estimates of a variable (frequency) that would otherwise be extremely difficult to measure.  


\subsection{Size data}
% Bird weights as an aid in taxonomy \cite{amadon1943bird}.
Beyond frequency it is plausible that physical and behavioral characteristics of birds both influence folk categorization. \citeA{hunn1999size} has documented that smaller species are more likely to be lumped together into large categories, and larger species are more likely to be given distinct names. Following his lead we evaluate bird size as an influence on categorization, and use size data from EltonTraits~\cite{wilman2014eltontraits} which includes information on key attributes for all 9993 extant bird species, including those from Oaxaca.  We use the body mass variable, separately sourced from \cite{dunning2007crc}, which is defined as the geometric mean of average values provided for both sexes. Beyond body mass EltonTraits includes variables related to diet types, foraging strata, and activity patterns, and future studies can explore whether and how these variables influence naming. 

\subsection{Phenotypic neighborhood}
% Bird weights as an aid in taxonomy \cite{amadon1943bird}.

An obvious factor affecting folk classification is that species are more likely to be grouped together if they look similar. We do not have detailed information about the appearance of species in our data set, but work with a similarity space (Figure~\ref{fig-morphospace}) that roughly captures similarity in physical appearance. \cite{pigot} generated a 9-dimensional morphospace based on body mass in addition to 8 variables related to beak shape and body shape, and we mapped their data down to the 
 2 dimensional space in Figure~\ref{fig-morphospace} by running tSNE \cite{XXX}, an algorithm for dimensionality reduction. As with all tSNE solutions, the axes (and axis units) in Figure~\ref{fig-morphospace} cannot be precisely interpreted, but the x axis corresponds fairly closely to body mass (correlation is 0.96), and the isolated group of points at the far left ( \textit{dz\v{i}n\b{g}}) includes hummingbirds.  We used the space in Figure~\ref{fig-morphospace} to derive a neighborhood size score that counts the number of species within a distance of 0.5 units. The mean neighborhood size across all species in Figure~\ref{fig-morphospace} is 1.5, but the mean for the hummingbirds alone is 3.7.

\subsection{Naming data}

Our naming data are based on a detailed folk taxonomy provided by \citeA{hunn2008zapotec} of the Zapotec language, from his fieldwork in San Juan Gb\"{e}\"{e}, a small village in Oaxaca, Mexico\footnote{
Also available online at \url{http://faculty.washington.edu/hunn/zapotec/z5.html}}. The data collected for birds consists of 69 folk-generic (basic level) names of bird categories, with corresponding folk-specific species, and their labels in Zapotec. For example, the folk-generic name for hummingbirds is \textit{dz\v{i}n\b{g}}, which covers 14 species of bird in Zapotec. These 14 species of hummingbird are partitioned into 4 categories corresponding to folk-specific labels; \textit{dz\v{\i}n\b{g}}, \textit{dz\v{\i}n\b{g}-d\'{a}n-y\v{a}-gu\`{i}}, \textit{dz\v{\i}n\b{g}-gu\'{e}}, \textit{and dz\v{\i}n\b{g}-y\v{a}-gu\`{i}}.

% More about how folk-generic and folk-specific relate to species and naming?

The scientific species labels used by our three sources of data (eBird, EltonTraits and Hunn's taxonomy) do not always match. We took the Clements checklist (used by eBird) as our gold standard \cite{clements2007clements}, and some manual preprocessing was required to align the eBird labels with the labels used by our other two resources. This resulted in 152 bird species named in Zapotec with corresponding frequencies and masses\footnote{All data and analysis code will be available on author's GitHub site.}.



\section{Analysis of category extensions}
% needs motivation
We focus first on the extensions of folk categories, and subsequently consider the labels or names given to these categories. We look at the distributions of birds with and without names in Zapotec, using the two environmental factors, in relation to all birds seen in Oaxaca (OAX) from eBird.
Figure~\ref{fig-birdfreqmassviolin} plots these distributions, with frequency on the left and mass on the right.

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{./figures/birdfreqmass-violinplots.png}
        \caption{Frequency densities (left) and Mass densitities (right) of birds named in Zapotec and those observed in the state of OAX.}
        \label{fig-birdfreqmassviolin}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Here we find that birds named in Zapotec tend to be the most frequently observed birds in Oaxaca. Mass, on the otherhand, does not appear to have an effect on whether a bird in Oaxaca is named or not in Zapotec. We ran a logistic regression which confirms that frequency is a strong predictor, while mass is not. Testing for mixed effects suggests that dropping frequency makes the model fit significantly worse ($p < 0.01$), but dropping mass doesn’t hurt the fit ($p = 0.59$). Akaike information criterion (AIC) values also support this conclusion. 
% (dropping logfreq makes the AIC bigger (ie worse), but dropping logmass makes the AIC a little bit better (smaller))

\subsection{Category organization}

Next we explore how named species are organized into categories. \citeA{hunn1999size} proposed that the size of an organism is influential in folk categorization and developed a measure which examines the degree to which the organisms are recognized taxonomically in the folk classification. 

Here we investigate a variant of Hunn's analyses, simply exploring how many folk generic category members each named species in Zapotec shares. For example, the folk-generic name for hummingbirds is \textit{dz\v{i}n\b{g}}, which covers 14 species of bird in Zapotec. We analyze this using both mass and frequency as predictors of how many species are grouped by name. Figure~\ref{fig-ssrr} presents plots for both frequency (left column) and mass (right column).

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./figures/ssrr-singlespecies.png}
        \caption{SSRR plots of single-species for both frequency (left column) and mass (right column).}
        \label{fig-ssrr}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Here we find that mass rather than frequency is a better predictor of category grouping. The $R^2$ for frequency is 0.01, and for mass is 0.20. The coefficients of a linear regression suggest that mass is a stronger predictor than frequency. Dropping either predictor, however, leads to a model fit that is significantly worse ($p < 0.01$) for mass and ($p = 0.03$) for frequency. AIC values support the same conclusion.

Overall, these findings support Hunn's conclusion that mass can predict the grouping behavior in folk categorization, while providing only weak evidence that frequency can do the same.




\section{Analysis of category labels}
Here we ask: of those birds that are named, whether frequency influences the form of the name for that species. Recall for example, there are 4 labels used for the 14 hummingbirds in Zapotec.

% \subsection{Name-length}
We analyzed the frequencies of birds named in Zapotec in relation to the name length of the bird. Opposite to our predictions (Zipfian), longer names had a slight tendency to be more frequent. The coefficients of a linear regression suggest that frequency and mass are both weak predictors. Dropping mass significantly impairs model performance ($p = 0.02$) but dropping frequency does not ($p = 0.2$). AIC scores support the same conclusion.

% See Figure~\ref{fig-freq-namelength}
% \begin{figure}[!ht]
%   \begin{center}
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./figures/freq-namelength.png}
%         \caption{Frequency densities of birds named in Zapotec as a function of name length.}
%         \label{fig-freq-namelength}
%   \end{center}
% \end{figure}



\subsection{Compound names}

Compound names exist in Hunn's bird naming data on Zapotec with a dash ('-'). Similar to English compound bird names like ``Hummingbird'' and ``Blackbird'', Zapotec has compound names of the form \textit{mgu\^{\i}n-gui\`{u}u} (``bird'' + ``river'') for the Black Phoebe and \textit{mgu\^{\i}n-rch\v{u}up} (``bird'' + ``whistle'') for the Dusky-capped Flycatcher.

Here we further examine names based on whether the Zapotec label is a single word (a monomial) or a compound of multiple words. Plots of both frequency and mass are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-both-nameforms}. 

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./figures/nameforms-both.png}
        \caption{Frequency and mass densities of birds named in Zapotec as a function of name form.}
        \label{fig-both-nameforms}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

While there is a slight tendency for monomials to have a higher frequency and higher mass, neither is significantly different. The coefficients of a logistic regression suggest that frequency is a stronger predictor than mass, and that if the frequency or mass of a species increase, it’s less likely to have a compound name. However, the results of a mixed-effect analysis suggest that the model fit doesn’t become significantly worse when either predictor is dropped ($p = 0.46$ and $p=0.78$). AIC scores support same conclusion.



\subsection{Prototypes}

Monomial labels have also been linked to prototypes in the categorization literature \cite{berlin1972speculations,berlin2014ethnobiological}. In particular, \citeA{berlin2014ethnobiological} proposes that prototypicality may be due to factors including frequency of occurrence. For simplicity, we examine unmarked-prototypes in Hunn's data on Zapotec bird-naming  \cite{hunn2008zapotec}. These are bird names that Hunn noted were monomials and were recognized at the same level taxa (had the same folk generic and folk specific names). 

We analyzed six prototypes; instances in which it was clear there was a single bird labeled as an unmarked prototype. See Figure \ref{fig-freq-prototype-all} to see the distribution for each of the prototype families. The top left bar chart shows the frequencies of vultures in Oaxaca, where we see the prototypical Turkey Vulture (in red) is clearly is more frequent. This trend holds across the other instances in the Hunn data, with an exception for the category of Owls (note this category has comparatively low frequency counts).


% We can address \cite{berlin2014ethnobiological}:
%  "Taxa of generic and subgeneric rank exhibit a specifiable internal
% structure where some members of a taxon, x, are thought of as being
% more prototypical of that taxon than others (i.e., are the best
% examples of the taxon). Taxa of intermediate and life-form rank may
% also show prototypicality effects. Prototypicality may be due to a
% number of factors, the most important of which appear to be taxonomic
% distinctiveness (as inferred from the scientific classification of the
% organisms in any local habitat), frequency of occurrence, and cultural
% importance (i.e., salience)."

% In addition, we note \cite{berlin1972speculations} for some speculation on prototypes and binomial labels:
% "A highly regular labeling process can be described for the encoding of
% specific taxa, given the primarily binary partition of a generic taxon. In
% general, one specific category, because it is most widespread, larger, best
% known, or the like, will always be recognized as the typical species of the
% folk genus. This taxon can be referred to as the type-specifict, he archetype,
% or the ideal type....
% As Wyman and Harris have said in referring to Navaho ethnobotany, 'The
% situation is as if in our binomial system the generic name were used alone for
% the best known species of a genus, while binomial terms were used for all other
%  members of the genus'"

% 5) pěch [`X´] ^[[SndMhpPch1]]: Cathartidae, New World vultures:
% 5a) pěch-msìdòo [`vulture´ + `eagle´] (= rên [`blood´]); King Vulture (Sarcoramphus papa): now, at least, very rare; might be known from travels to the Isthmus of Tehuántepec; one older man reported the name and that it did occur in San Juan Gbëë; the generic synonym was noted by Reeck (1991);
% 5b) pěch-rúx [`vulture´ + `naked´] (= ngól̲-běts [X + Y]); Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus): less common and widespread than the next; the generic synonym was reported by Reeck;
% 5c) pěch[-0] [`vulture´, unmarked prototype] (= pěch-yèts [`vulture´ + `yellowish´]); Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura): the prototypical vulture; normally simply named pěch.

\end{figure*}


% We also examined the distribution of the frequencies of birds in Zapotec split into groups based on whether the label is an unmarked prototype or not. We found those that are prototypes are highest in frequency (m=7.93 vs. m=7.02 for log frequency of prototypes and non-prototypes respectively).

\section{Discussion}

% This work extends the investigation of language categories using large-scale datasets online \cite{kemp2012kinship,regier2016languages}
% Summary of some of the questions we could explore using the methods detailed above.

Questions of how categories of natural kinds are named have a long history in anthropology and psychology. There has been a particular debate over the influence of the external environment on how people partition the world. Recent large-scale digital datasets allow us to test old questions in a new light. In this paper we use frequency of occurrence and physical size of birds to examine the naming patterns of a particular folk categorization system. We found evidence that frequency predicts whether or not a species is named, and when a species is an unmarked prototype, as well as weak evidence that it predicts lumping. We replicated \citeA{hunn1999size} and found size predicts lumping (and find that it's a stronger predictor than frequency), but found only weak evidence that it predicts anything else.

Reasons why we don’t see a stronger effect of frequency (discuss wrt theories that do predict frequency effects including functional/utilitarian view, Zipfian view, perhaps others)

Distribution of species in morphospace is an important confound in lumping, compound vs monomial and namelength analyses. Possible that similarity is the big thing: e.g if a species is very similar to many other species than we’d expect to have a high lumping score independent of mass and frequency, and might also expect to have a compound name that reflects the relationship of the species to other similar things.

Future direction: include similarity as predictor. Use the data in that recent paper (Macroevolutionary convergence connects morphological form to ecological function in birds) to add a “neighborhood density” variable that captures how many other local species a given species is similar to.

% \subsection{Potential concerns}

We also address potential concerns that can arise in using eBird frequency of observation data here. Does frequency of observation in eBird accurately represent the statistic of interest? (SOME CITATIONS to back up this claim). Also: These questions are interesting because we typically take for granted the categories of natural kinds. However, scientific taxonomies are just another human-constructed category system. When considering the set of birds in particular, it has been difficult for biologists to agree on a standardized taxonomy, which has been shown to severely impact decisions on conservation policy \cite{peterson2006taxonomy,garnett2017taxonomy}.

\subsection{Future Directions}
The next step would be to expand these analyses to more languages. To do this one needs to find trustworthy ethnographies similar to the Zapotec naming data we used here from \citeA{hunn2008zapotec}, and one needs decent coverage in eBird over the geographic region in question. Clear next steps would be to analyze the Tzeltal language from Chiapas, Mexico, and the Tlingit language from the south-east Alaska, both published by Hunn as well \cite{hunn1977tzeltal,hunn2012tlingit}, which have decent coverage within their respective geographics regions in eBird observational data. 

That said, it can be difficult to find languages with both expert ethnographries of the folk biological naming systems which also have good coverage in eBird. This has prohibited us from exploring bird naming data from known experts in regions with low coverage in eBird (e.g., naming data summarized in \cite{holman2002relation}, including the Tobelo language from Indonesia \cite{taylor1990folk} and the Anindilyakwa language from Australia \cite{waddy1988classification}, which do not have coverage in eBird currently).

In addition to more languages, we plan to include more environmental features in our analyses. Recall our observation about the owl prototypes above: this was an interesting insight which could have been found by adding additional environmental feature data from EltonTraits \cite{wilman2014eltontraits}. For example, there are features which would indicate that these birds were all nocturnal, and give rise to the natural question: do all norturnal birds logged in eBird have very low frequency of observation like Owls?

% \subsection{Figures}

% All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
% not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
% number and caption, in 10~point, after the figure with one line space
% above the caption and one line space below it, as in
% Figure~\ref{sample-figure}. If necessary, leave extra white space at
% the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
% caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, and
% you may set wide figures across both columns.

% \begin{figure}[H]

% \caption{This is a figure.}

% \section{References Instructions}

% Follow the APA Publication Manual for citation format, both within the
% text and in the reference list, with the following exceptions: (a) do
% not cite the page numbers of any book, including chapters in edited
% volumes; (b) use the same format for unpublished references as for
% published ones. Alphabetize references by the surnames of the authors,
% with single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
% references by the same authors by the year of publication, with the
% earliest first.

% Use a first level section heading, ``{\bf References}'', as shown
% below. Use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the
% reference flush against the left margin and subsequent lines indented
% by 1/8~inch. Below are example references for a conference paper, book
% chapter, journal article, dissertation, book, technical report, and
% edited volume, respectively.
